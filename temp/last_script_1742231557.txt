**[INTRODUCTION]**
**Host A:** Welcome to another episode of "Tech & Innovation," where we dive into the fascinating world of technology and the people shaping it. Today, we're going to talk about AI—artificial intelligence. AI isn't just a buzzword; it's a game-changer. From predicting invoice payments to improving self-driving cars, AI is transforming industries. Joining me today is Host B. Welcome!
**Host B:** Thanks for having me. I'm excited to share this story because it's all about turning visions into reality through AI. It's inspiring and shows just how powerful AI can be when applied to real-world problems.
**Host A:** Absolutely. Let's dive in.

**[DISCUSSION BEGINS]**
**Host A:** So, let's start with the basics. The story begins with an internship at HighRadius, a fintech company. What exactly did they do, and how did AI come into play?
**Host B:** HighRadius focuses on solving one of the biggest headaches for businesses: getting paid on time. Many B2B companies deal with clients who take their time paying invoices. Predicting when clients will pay is tough, especially when you have hundreds or even thousands of clients. That's where AI stepped in.
**Host A:** Right, cash flow is crucial for any business. If you can't predict when you'll get paid, it's hard to plan for the future. How did the team at HighRadius approach this problem?
**Host B:** They built an AI-enabled invoice management system. The goal was to predict when invoices would be paid with high accuracy. And guess what? It worked amazingly well.
**Host A:** That sounds impressive. Let's get into the technical details because I know our listeners love that. What technologies were used to build this system?
**Host B:** The frontend was built using ReactJS, which gave the system a sleek and user-friendly interface. Java servlets handled the backend, ensuring everything ran smoothly. SQL was used to manage the data, which is essential for any AI model. But the real magic was the machine learning model they implemented.
**Host A:** Machine learning is where AI shines. Which algorithm did they use?
**Host B:** They used XGBoost, a popular and powerful machine learning model known for its accuracy and speed. They fed it over a million historical transactions, tweaked it, and voilà! It started predicting payment dates with 92% accuracy.
**Host A:** 92% accuracy is incredible. That's not just a marginal improvement; it's a game-changer. How did this impact the business?
**Host B:** The impact was huge. HighRadius could now see the future, in a way. By predicting when invoices would be paid, they could proactively manage payments, reduce delays, and keep cash flowing smoothly. This led to a significant reduction in overdue payments, which directly affected the bottom line.
**Host A:** That makes sense. It's not just about tech for the sake of tech; it's about solving a real problem that affects the company's financial health. It's impressive how AI can be applied in such a practical way.
**Host B:** Absolutely. And what's even cooler is that this system isn't just for HighRadius. It's a solution that can be applied to any business struggling with invoice management.
**Host A:** Now, switching gears a bit. The story doesn't stop at HighRadius. There's another exciting project involving computer vision and deep learning. Let's talk about that.
**Host B:** Yes, during undergrad, there was this project on image dehazing. It's about teaching computers to see clearly through fog. It might sound niche, but the applications are vast.
**Host A:** Image dehazing? That sounds like something out of a sci-fi movie. How does it work?
**Host B:** Essentially, it's about enhancing images or videos taken in foggy conditions. The goal is to make the images clearer, which is crucial for applications like self-driving cars, military tech, satellites, and drones.
**Host A:** That's fascinating. Self-driving cars, for example, rely heavily on cameras and sensors to navigate. Fog can be a major obstacle. If you can dehaze images in real-time, it improves safety and functionality.
**Host B:** Exactly. And the best part? This project achieved a novel 90% accuracy in image dehazing. That's a breakthrough.
**Host A:** 90% accuracy is impressive. It's not perfect, but it's close. How does this compare to existing methods?
**Host B:** Previous methods were either less accurate or too slow for real-time applications. This solution was both accurate and efficient, making it practical for real-world use.
**Host A:** That's the key. Innovation is great, but it's only meaningful if it can be applied in real-world scenarios. It's clear that AI isn't just about solving abstract problems; it's about making tangible improvements in various industries.

**[TRANSITION TO CHEWY]**
**Host A:** Now, let's bring this back to Chewy. Chewy isn't a financial or accounting firm, so how can they leverage AI effectively?
**Host B:** That's a great question. Chewy is in the pet industry, but AI can still play a huge role. From personalized recommendations to optimizing supply chains, AI can enhance the customer experience and streamline operations.
**Host A:** Personalized recommendations are a big one. If Chewy can use AI to suggest products based on a customer's pet's preferences or needs, it can create a more tailored shopping experience.
**Host B:** Exactly. And it's not just about products. AI can help with customer service, inventory management, and even predicting demand for certain products.
**Host A:** That makes sense. AI can analyze customer behavior, purchasing patterns, and preferences to anticipate what they might need next. It's about creating a seamless and intuitive shopping experience.
**Host B:** Absolutely. And the best part is that AI can scale with Chewy's growth. As the company expands, AI can handle more data, providing even better insights and predictions.
**Host A:** It's all about leveraging data to make smarter decisions. AI isn't here to replace humans but to augment our capabilities and make processes more efficient.
**Host B:** Exactly. AI is a tool that can help businesses like Chewy stay ahead of the competition and provide better services to their customers.
