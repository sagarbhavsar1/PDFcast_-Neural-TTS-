**Host A:** Welcome to *Tech Talent Today*, the podcast where we dive into the fascinating journeys of rising stars in the tech world. I’m your host, Alex.
**Host B:** And I’m your co-host, Jamie. Today, we’re shining the spotlight on Sagar Bhavsar, a name that’s making waves in the data science and engineering space. Sagar is currently pursuing his Master’s in Information Systems at New York University’s Stern School of Business and has an impressive background in computer science engineering from SRM Institute of Science and Technology in Chennai, India.
**Host A:** That’s right, Jamie. Sagar’s resume is a treasure trove of technical skills, hands-on experience, and innovative projects. Let’s break it down and see what makes him stand out in the competitive world of tech.
**Host B:** Absolutely. Let’s start with his education. Sagar is currently at NYU, where he’s not just a student but also a Teaching Assistant for courses like Databases for Business Analytics and Machine Learning. That’s a pretty impressive feat.
**Host A:** It certainly is. And let’s not forget his undergrad at SRM Institute. He graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science Engineering, which laid the foundation for his technical prowess. But education is just one part of the story. Let’s talk about his skills.
**Host B:** Sagar’s technical skills are quite extensive. He’s proficient in languages like Python, R, SQL, C++, and Java, to name a few. He’s also well-versed in frameworks and tools like PyTorch, TensorFlow, Django, Docker, Kubernetes, and a lot more. It’s like he’s checked every box on the list of what a modern data scientist or engineer needs.
**Host A:** And it’s not just about knowing these tools. Sagar has applied them in real-world scenarios, which we’ll get into shortly. But first, let’s talk about his work experience. He’s currently working as a Data Engineer at NYU Stern, where he’s made some significant contributions.
**Host B:** That’s right. In his role as a Data Engineer, Sagar has optimized ETL pipelines, handling over 500,000 PHI records daily. That’s a massive undertaking, especially considering the need for data integrity and privacy. He’s also integrated over 10 new data sources, which has improved the analytics team’s data accessibility by 40%.
**Host A:** Those are some serious numbers. And if that weren’t enough, he’s also implemented CI/CD pipelines using Docker and Kubernetes, reducing deployment failures by 65%. That’s a huge win for any team.
**Host B:** Absolutely. It’s clear that Sagar has a knack for streamlining processes and making data more accessible and reliable. But his experience doesn’t stop there. He also had a stint as an Analytics Intern at EasyTransfer, a part of Cashfree Payments.
**Host A:** During his time at EasyTransfer, Sagar worked on a marketing campaign using predictive modeling. He implemented ensemble classification models to identify high-value customer segments and even set up a Bayesian A/B testing framework. This effort led to a 15% increase in email click-through rates.
**Host B:** That’s fascinating. He also developed a data pipeline using Google Analytics and BigQuery to track user behavior, processing over a million daily events. And by employing Markov chain analysis, he helped optimize the conversion funnel, reducing bounce rates by 20%.
**Host A:** It’s clear that Sagar has a deep understanding of user behavior and how to leverage data to drive business outcomes. But let’s not forget his earlier role as a Data Science Intern at HighRadius in Houston, Texas.
**Host B:** Yes. At HighRadius, Sagar developed a full-stack invoice management system using ReactJS for the frontend, Java Servlets for the backend, and SQL for the database. He also integrated machine learning to predict payment dates and categorize invoices, which reduced overdue payments by 15%.
**Host A:** That’s incredibly impressive. He also built and deployed XGBoost models to predict invoice clearance dates with 92% accuracy. And by analyzing these insights, he helped the sales team improve client acquisition by 17%.
**Host B:** It’s amazing how he’s consistently delivered impactful results in every role he’s taken on. But Sagar’s not just about work; he’s also a hands-on project developer. Let’s talk about some of his projects.
**Host A:** One of his notable projects is the Cadillac Website Enhancement, where he built a chatbot using Google Flan-T5 and ChromaDB. This chatbot handles over 500 user queries daily. He also developed an image-to-text feature using a ResNet18 CNN model trained on over 60,000 car images. The project was deployed on AWS, reducing training time by 50%.
**Host B:** That’s some serious AI and machine learning in action. Another project worth mentioning is his Image De-hazer System, where he designed a CNN model for image upscaling and dehazing, achieving 90% novel accuracy. This project was published in IEEE and presented at ICECONF’23.
**Host A:** It’s clear that Sagar has a strong foundation in deep learning and computer vision. And let’s not forget his Financial Advisor LLM System, where he engineered an AI system for real-time financial advice using LLama 3.1 and other open-source LLMs. He created pipelines to refine the LLM with financial data, capture live news, and provide real-time advice.
**Host B:** That’s a forward-thinking project, especially with the rise of LLMs in various industries. It’s evident that Sagar is not just keeping up with the latest technologies but is actively contributing to their development and application.
**Host A:** In addition to his technical work, Sagar has also earned several certifications and participated in virtual internships. He completed a Data Science Internship with Boston Consulting Group, won a Research Paper Presentation Award at ICECONF’23, and underwent training in Linux and Data Analysis from Vodafone, among others.
**Host B:** And let’s not overlook his leadership and extracurricular activities. At NYU Stern, he’s a Course Supervisor and Teaching Fellow for several courses, including Databases for Business Analytics and Business Communication. He’s also the Vice Chairman of the SRM Data Science Club, which has over 300 members, promoting data science education and community engagement.
**Host A:** It’s clear that Sagar is not just a tech whiz but also a leader and educator. His ability to communicate complex concepts and lead teams is just as impressive as his technical skills.
**Host B:** And let’s not forget his achievements outside of academics and work. Sagar is a national-level table tennis player with over 100 awards, showcasing his discipline, focus, and teamwork skills.
**Host A:** It’s inspiring to see someone excel in both technical and extracurricular fields. Now, as we wrap up, let’s summarize what makes Sagar Bhavsar such a standout candidate.
