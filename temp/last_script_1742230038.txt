**[Podcast Script - Part 1: Influence Without Authority]**
**[INTRO MUSIC FADES OUT]**
**Host A:** Welcome to *The Leadership Lens*, where we explore the complexities of influence and authority in modern organizations. I'm Host A.
**Host B:** And I'm Host B. Today, we're diving into a fascinating topic: how to influence others when you don't have formal authority over them. It's a challenge many of us face, whether we're managers, team members, or even freelancers. Let's start with a real-world example that really grabbed my attention.
**Host A:** That's right. Let's talk about Bill Heatton, the director of research at a $250 million division of a large West Coast company. His division specializes in telecommunications components, and while they've had some technical successes, their financial performance has been inconsistent. Bill's frustration comes from his struggles to influence two key colleagues: Ted, the marketing director, and Roland, the program manager who reports to Ted.
**Host B:** Wow, okay, so Bill is dealing with a classic problem. He wants to influence people who don't report to him, and it's not going well. Let me summarize what's happening here. Bill sees Roland as a liability because Roland was responsible for a major loss in a previous program, and now he's in charge of another one. Bill tried to convince Ted to replace Roland, but Ted hasn't acted on it. Instead, Ted started focusing on problems in Bill's area.
**Host A:** Exactly. So Bill decided to change his staffing plan, assigning people to Roland's program against his staff's advice. But even after that, Roland isn't providing the necessary progress reports, and he's unavailable for planning. Bill is getting frustrated because he's trying to be proactive, but he's not getting any response or action from Roland. He's stuck in a loop, and it's causing tension.
**Host B:** That sounds really frustrating. I can imagine how Bill feels. He's trying to solve the problem, but his efforts aren't leading to any meaningful change. He even considers a "tit-for-tat" strategy, but he's worried it might hurt the organization. That's a tough spot to be in.
**Host A:** It is. And what's even more interesting is that Bill feels stuck because he doesn't want to escalate the issue to their boss, the general manager. In a matrix organization, going to your boss is seen as a failure, so Bill is trying to handle it on his own. But he's worried that if he doesn't get results, he'll be blamed when the program fails.
**Host B:** That's a classic Catch-22. He's trying to influence without authority, but the lack of response is making him feel powerless. It's like he's hitting a brick wall, and he doesn't know how to move forward without causing more harm.
**Host A:** Exactly. And this is a common challenge in organizations. When you don't have formal authority, you have to rely on other mechanisms to influence people. That's where concepts like reciprocity and exchange come into play.
**Host B:** Right. The law of reciprocity is a key idea here. It's the belief that people should reciprocate favors or actions. If you do something for me, I'll do something for you. It's a fundamental principle of human interaction, and it's especially important in situations where you don't have formal authority.
**Host A:** Absolutely. And this is exactly what Allan R. Cohen and David L. Bradford explore in their work on influence without authority. They argue that informal networks of mutual influence are crucial for getting things done in organizations.
**Host B:** So, let's unpack that a bit more. The idea is that in today's organizations, you can't just rely on formal authority to get things done. You need to build relationships and create value for others so that they are motivated to help you. It's about creating a mutual exchange where both parties benefit.
**Host A:** Exactly. And this is where Bill is struggling. He's trying to influence Roland and Ted, but he's not creating a mutual exchange. He's trying to force his way, but that's not working. Instead, he needs to think about how he can create value for them so that they are motivated to help him.
**Host B:** That makes sense. But how exactly does that work? Let's think about it in practical terms. How can someone like Bill create a mutual exchange with someone like Roland?
**Host A:** Well, one way is to offer something in exchange for what you want. For example, Bill could offer to help Roland with one of his priorities in exchange for Roland providing the progress reports. This way, both parties benefit, and the relationship becomes more collaborative.
**Host B:** That's a great point. It's all about finding a win-win situation. But how do you figure out what the other person values? You can't just assume you know what they need.
**Host A:** Exactly. That's where communication and empathy come into play. You need to understand what the other person is trying to achieve and how you can help them. Once you know that, you can offer something in exchange.
**Host B:** That makes sense. It's about building a relationship and creating mutual value. But how do you start that process? It seems like it could be really challenging, especially if the other person is resistant.
**Host A:** It definitely can be challenging, but it's worth it. The key is to start small. Find a way to help the other person with something they value, and then build from there. Over time, you can create a relationship based on mutual trust and reciprocity.
**Host B:** That's a good strategy. But what if the other person doesn't want to engage? How do you handle that?
**Host A:** That's a tough question. Sometimes, people are resistant to change or don't see the value in collaborating. In those cases, you might need to think creatively about what you can offer. It could be something as simple as sharing information or connecting them with someone who can help them.
**Host B:** That's interesting. It's all about finding that initial offer that can break the ice and create a sense of reciprocity. Once you have that, you can build on it over time.
**Host A:** Exactly. And this is exactly what Allan R. Cohen and David L. Bradford are talking about in their work. They emphasize the importance of building these informal networks of influence through reciprocity and exchange.
**Host B:** So, in summary, influencing without authority requires a shift from trying to force or demand action to creating mutual value and building relationships. It's about understanding what the other person needs and offering something in exchange.
**Host A:** Exactly. And this approach not only makes it more likely that you'll get what you want but also builds stronger, more collaborative relationships in the long run.
**Host B:** That's a great point. It's not just about getting what you want in the short term; it's about building a foundation for future collaboration and influence.
**Host A:** Absolutely. And this is something that we'll explore more in the next part of this podcast. We'll dive deeper into the strategies and techniques for influencing without authority, and we'll share more examples and insights from the work of Allan R. Cohen and David L. Bradford.
**Host B:** So, if you're struggling with influencing others without formal authority, stay tuned. We have a lot more to share that will help you navigate these challenging situations.

**Host A:** So, we're diving deeper into how reciprocity works in organizations. It's fascinating how this principle is the backbone of so many interactions, right?
**Host B:** Absolutely! It's like the unsaid rule that keeps things running smoothly. But I'm curious, why do you think people like Bill Heatton struggle with it?
**Host A:** Well, Bill's case is a perfect example. He helped the marketing department, expecting something in return, but when it didn't happen, he got angry. It shows he understood the concept but not the execution.
**Host B:** That's so true. I remember a time when my boss asked me to work weekends without even a thank you. It was frustrating, but I hoped he'd make it up somehow. When he didn't, it felt like a violation.
**Host A:** Exactly. It's not just about big favors; it's the little things too. A simple thank you can be a powerful currency. But what counts as fair exchange can vary widely.
**Host B:** Right, like in my case, a thank you would have been enough, but for someone else, it might require more. So, how do we navigate that?
**Host A:** It's all about understanding the currencies involved. It's not just money or promotions. It could be support, information, or even praise. Each person values different things.
**Host B:** That makes sense. I once had a colleague who loved public recognition. A shout-out in a meeting meant the world to him. But another colleague found it cheesy.
**Host A:** So, the key is to know your audience. What's valuable to one person might not be to another. It's like knowing the right gift for someone.
**Host B:** And it's not just about giving; it's also about timing. Sometimes, immediate recognition works, but other times, delayed gratitude is better.
**Host A:** Absolutely. It's about building trust over time. Consistent small gestures can be more impactful than one grand gesture.
**Host B:** This makes me think about leadership. Leaders who understand this can build stronger teams. It's not just about authority, but about these subtle exchanges.
**Host A:** Precisely. It's the art of give-and-take. When done right, it fosters a positive work environment. When ignored, it can lead to resentment.
**Host B:** So, in a way, reciprocity is about empathy and understanding what drives your team. It's not one-size-fits-all.
**Host A:** Exactly. It's about being attuned to your colleagues' needs and preferences. That's where the real influence lies.
**Host B:** Wow, this is eye-opening. It's not just about doing favors, but about creating a mutual respect system.
**Host A:** And it's crucial during changes. When routines are disrupted, these exchanges become more unpredictable, but the expectation of fairness remains.
**Host B:** So, how do we set these exchange rates? It's tricky because fairness is subjective.
**Host A:** It's about communication and consistency. Over time, you develop a sense of what's fair for each person.
**Host B:** That makes sense. It's like learning a new language; you get better with practice.
**Host A:** And sometimes, it's the little things that matter most. A genuine thank you or a moment of recognition can go a long way.
**Host B:** I couldn't agree more. It's the small, consistent efforts that build strong, resilient relationships.
**Host A:** Well, that's all for this part. Tune in next time as we explore more on this topic.
**Host B:** Thanks for listening, everyone!
**[Podcast Script: Part 3 of 6]**
**Host A:** So, last time we talked about how influence is all about these exchanges, right? Like, it's not just asking for something; it's giving something in return. But today, I want to dive into how we actually make that exchange work. Because, let's face it, it's not always easy.
**Host B:** [excitedly] Oh, I know! It's like, you can't just walk up to someone and expect them to help you without giving anything back. But how do you even start figuring out what they want?
**Host A:** Exactly. The key is to treat them as a potential ally, not an adversary. Think of them as someone you're collaborating with, not convincing. But how do you do that?
**Host B:** [curious] So, you're saying we need to understand their world? Like, what they value and what they're dealing with?
**Host A:** [nodding] Yes. It's about empathy. Take Bill Heatton and Ted. Bill wanted Ted to remove Roland from the project, but he never stopped to think about why Ted was hesitant. Did Ted think Roland could improve? Or maybe Ted believed Roland wasn't the problem?
**Host B:** [surprised] Wow, that makes sense. So, Bill just charged ahead without considering Ted's perspective. That's a classic mistake.
**Host A:** [agreeing] Right. And that's where these "organizational currencies" come in. They're like the different ways we can exchange value. Let me explain.
**Host B:** [eagerly] Okay, I'm curious. What are these currencies?
**Host A:** Well, they're things like inspiration, tasks, position, relationships, and personal stuff. For example, someone might value being part of a significant task or getting recognition.
**Host B:** [excited] Oh, like when I once offered to help a colleague with their project, and they were so grateful. It turned out they really needed the help, and it built a great relationship.
**Host A:** [smiling] Exactly. It's about finding what matters to them. But sometimes, we miss the mark because we don't take the time to understand their pressures.
**Host B:** [thoughtful] Yeah, like when I tried to convince my teammate to change our project plan, but I didn't realize their bonus depended on meeting certain metrics. They weren't being stubborn; they were just trying to meet their targets.
**Host A:** [nodding] That's it. We stereotype them instead of seeing their situation. Like, "Oh, they're just being difficult," without understanding their constraints.
**Host B:** [reflective] It's so easy to jump to conclusions. But taking the time to really understand where they're coming from makes all the difference.
**Host A:** [concluding] So, the next time you're trying to influence someone, remember: they're a potential ally, not an enemy. Take a moment to see things from their perspective. It might just change the game.
**Host B:** [excited] Definitely. Understanding their world and what they value can turn a confrontation into a collaboration. Thanks for tuning in, everyone. Join us next time as we explore more on this topic.

**Host A:** So, we were talking about how managers might resist changes even if they care about the company or customers. It's not just about being inflexible, right? There's a lot going on behind the scenes.
**Host B:** Exactly. Like, the daily demands on their time, how much they interact with customers or suppliers, the flow of information in the organization—or lack of it. Even their boss's style and what their coworkers believe can influence their behavior.
**Host A:** And it's not just about understanding these factors; it's about using that understanding to frame your requests better. Instead of seeing someone as just a non-cooperator, you can tailor your approach.
**Host B:** Right, but here's the thing: influencers often aren't even clear on what they really want. They might have a bunch of needs all jumbled together—like a specific product, arranged a certain way, delivered at a certain time. But they haven't thought about what's non-negotiable and what they can compromise on.
**Host A:** Exactly. Like Bill Heatton: Did he want Ted removed, or did he just want the project managed better? And did he want Ted to make concessions, or was he just after better progress reports? It's easy to confuse the end goal with the means.
**Host B:** And this ties into something else: influencers often don't realize the range of "currencies" they have to offer. Even if they're lower in the organization, they might have something valuable to exchange. But they get stuck feeling powerless and don't see their own leverage.
**Host A:** And then there's the issue of interaction styles. Everyone has a way of working with others, but people often don't realize their own style—or they think it's the only way. For example, if you're someone who likes to socialize first and then dive into work, that might clash with someone who just wants to get straight to the task.
**Host B:** Exactly. And this can really mess things up if you don't adjust your approach. Like, if you're someone who starts with open-ended questions, but the other person wants concrete answers first, you're gonna hit a wall.
**Host A:** Now, let's talk about the exchange itself. A lot of these issues stem from not handling the first three factors well—like not seeing someone as a potential ally or not understanding their world. But even when you do, there are specific problems that pop up.
**Host B:** Like knowing how to use reciprocity. You have to state your needs clearly without overdoing it, understand the other person's needs without being manipulative, and aim for mutual gain instead of a "winner takes all" situation.
**Host A:** And then there's the trap of wanting to be right instead of effective. Professionals especially fall into this because they're so tied to their version of "truth." They stick to their way, even if it's not working for the situation.
**Host B:** Yeah, and then there's the overuse of what's worked before. Like John Brucker, who always entertained people to get support for his programs. It worked for a while, but when he tried it with William Adams, it totally backfired because Adams saw it as unnecessary.
**Host A:** So, the takeaway here is that you have to stay flexible and really understand the person you're trying to influence. Otherwise, you might end up like Bill Heatton, stuck in a cycle of missed opportunities.
**Host A:** So, we’re diving back into how relationships shape influence in organizations. It’s fascinating how these dynamics can make or break initiatives.
**Host B:** [Curious] I know, right? It’s like, you can have the best idea, but if your relationship with the decision-maker is off, it might not matter. What’s the key here?
**Host A:** Exactly. The PDF talks about how the depth of your relationship affects the ease of influence. If you’ve built trust over time, it’s smoother. Both parties know each other’s priorities and pressures, making collaboration easier.
**Host B:** [Nodding] That makes sense. So, if you’ve worked together before, you have a shorthand, right? Less guessing about intentions.
**Host A:** [Agreeing] And when the relationship is poor, it’s like pulling teeth. Distrust makes everything harder. The other party might demand immediate returns, no credit, which limits flexibility.
**Host B:** [Interrupting] Like the Brucker and Adams example. Brucker tried to be friendly, but Adams saw it as insincere, right?
**Host A:** [Detailing] Yes. Brucker’s approach of inviting Adams to dinner backfired. Adams felt it was a cheap tactic, so he resisted even more. Brucker didn’t realize Adams had integrity and genuinely cared about the organization.
**Host B:** [Surprised] Wow, so Brucker’s strategy not only failed but also ruined any future influence he might have had. That’s a cautionary tale.
**Host A:** [Analytical] It shows how misaligned approaches can damage relationships. Brucker didn’t grasp Adams’s values, leading to a lost opportunity.
**Host B:** [Connecting] It’s like that high-tech company example. The president wanted to maximize profits, while the chairman valued innovation over money.
**Host A:** [Explaining] Exactly. Their currencies weren’t compatible. The president wanted financial gain, the chairman, technological challenges. No common ground, so they parted ways.
**Host B:** [Reflective] It’s tough when you can’t find that middle ground. But the key takeaway is to try every avenue before giving up, right?
**Host A:** [Concluding] Absolutely. Sometimes, even with all the strategies, it doesn’t work, but you have to try. And remember, relationships matter beyond just the task. They’re investments in future collaborations.
**Host B:** [Enthusiastic] So, it’s not just about winning this battle but the war. You have to nurture those relationships for long-term success.
**Host A:** [Smiling] Exactly. It’s a balance between achieving your goals and maintaining relationships. Sometimes, the latter is more important.
**Host B:** [Curious] I wonder how the president felt after leaving. Did he learn something from that experience?
**Host A:** [Speculative] Maybe he realized the importance of aligning values before taking on a role. It’s a good lesson for all of us.
**Host B:** [Agreeing] Definitely. It’s a reminder to understand the other person’s perspective before pushing your agenda.
**Host A:** [Closing] Well, that’s a wrap for today. Tune in next time as we explore more on influence and leadership.
**Host B:** [Teasing] And maybe some personal anecdotes next time. [Laughs]
**Host A:** [Laughing] We’ll see. Thanks for tuning in, everyone!
**Host B:** [Enthusiastic] Thanks for listening!
**[Podcast Script Part 6/6]**
**Host A:** Alright, so we’ve covered a lot in this series about influence and alliances in the workplace. Let me try to wrap this up for our listeners. It all comes down to one thing: relationships. Whether you’re a manager, an employee, or even a freelancer, building the right connections and knowing how to influence people is crucial to getting things done.
**Host B:** [jumping in] Exactly! And it’s not just about having a big network, right? It’s about how you use those relationships. I mean, Robert Kaplan talked about trade routes—like, the pathways of influence that managers need to build. And John Kotter’s work showed that successful managers have these wide networks that help them find the right people to make things happen. It’s not just about knowing people; it’s about knowing how to leverage those connections.
**Host A:** [nodding] And then there’s Rosabeth Moss Kanter’s work on change masters. She really dives into how innovative people in organizations build coalitions and overcome resistance. We’ve built on her work by looking at the actual mechanisms behind those processes. So, it’s not just theory; it’s practical steps you can take.
**Host B:** [curious] So, what are some of those practical steps? I mean, we’ve talked about influence styles and negotiation, but what’s the takeaway for someone listening who wants to improve their own influence at work?
**Host A:** [thoughtful] Well, one thing that stands out is the idea of mutual influence. In our book, *Managing for Excellence*, we argue that shared responsibility with subordinates is key. Treating them as full partners, even when you have formal authority, allows both parties to use their full strength. It’s about collaboration, not just top-down control.
**Host B:** [excited] And that ties into the negotiation literature, right? Roger Fisher and William Ury’s *Getting to Yes* is all about finding common interests even when you have different goals. It’s a great approach for building alliances. And Roy Lewicki’s work on exchange and equity is super relevant here too. It’s all about fairness and reciprocity in relationships.
**Host A:** [smirking] And let’s not forget the cautionary tales. David Kipnis found that some managers just give up trying to influence because they lack organizational power. That’s a problem because influence isn’t just about formal authority; it’s about how you use the resources you have.
**Host B:** [interrupting] Right! And John Kotter’s work on power in management shows the pros and cons of different influence methods. It’s not a one-size-fits-all situation. You have to adapt your approach based on the context and the people you’re dealing with.
**Host A:** [concluding] So, to sum it all up, influence is about building alliances, using negotiation strategies, and understanding the dynamics of power and relationships. It’s not rocket science, but it does take effort and intentionality. And the payoff is huge—getting things done, driving innovation, and succeeding in a world where formal authority often isn’t enough.
**Host B:** [enthusiastic] And I think that’s a great way to end this series. For our listeners, the key takeaway is this: Start building those relationships, start paying attention to how you influence and are influenced by others, and don’t be afraid to adapt your approach. Trust us, it’ll make a difference.
