**[INTRO MUSIC FADES IN]**
**Host A:**
Welcome to this episode of *DevOps Discussions*! I’m your host, Alex, and joining me today is my co-host, Sam. Today, we’re diving into the world of Kubernetes and CI/CD pipelines. If you’re working on a project that involves deploying microservices, this episode is for you. Let’s get started!
**Host B (Sam):**
Hey everyone! Thanks for tuning in. Kubernetes and CI/CD pipelines are hot topics right now, especially for teams looking to streamline their deployment processes. Let’s break this down step by step.

**[SEGMENT 1: PROJECT OVERVIEW]**
**Host A:**
So, Sam, let’s start with the basics. What’s the main goal of this project?
**Host B (Sam):**
The main goal is to deploy a RESTful microservice to a Kubernetes cluster using a CI/CD pipeline. This project is part of a DevOps course, and it’s designed to give students hands-on experience with agile methodologies and automated deployments.
**Host A:**
That makes sense. And how long do students have to complete this project?
**Host B (Sam):**
They have 8 weeks in total. The project is divided into a 1-week planning phase and three sprints, each lasting 2 weeks. However, due to Spring Break, one of the sprints will be 3 weeks long. The deadlines are clearly outlined, and late submissions will incur a 10% penalty. No submissions will be accepted after the second deadline, so time management is crucial.
**Host A:**
Time management is always a challenge in software development. Let’s talk about the structure of the project. What are the key milestones?
**Host B (Sam):**
The project is divided into several requirements, each focusing on a different aspect of the deployment process. These include adding query and action routes to the microservice, implementing continuous integration, deploying to Kubernetes, creating a user interface with automated BDD testing, refactoring the service using Flask-RESTX, and building a continuous delivery pipeline.
**Host A:**
Wow, that’s a lot! Let’s break these down one by one.

**[SEGMENT 2: REQUIREMENTS OVERVIEW]**
**Host A:**
The first requirement is to add query and action routes to the microservice. Can you explain what that means?
**Host B (Sam):**
Sure. A query route allows users to filter results based on specific attributes. For example, if your microservice lists products, a query could filter them by price or category. An action route, on the other hand, is used for operations that don’t fit into the standard CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) model. Think of actions like canceling an order or liking a product.
**Host A:**
That’s a great way to explain it. So, students need to enhance their existing API to support these features. How do they ensure their tests still pass after making these changes?
**Host B (Sam):**
They need to maintain 95%+ code coverage. This means their test cases should cover almost all of their code. Before creating pull requests, they should run their tests to ensure everything works as expected.
**Host A:**
Testing is crucial. Let’s move on to the next requirement: continuous integration. What does that involve?
**Host B (Sam):**
Continuous integration (CI) ensures that every pull request runs through automated tests and quality checks. Students will use GitHub Actions to set this up. They’ll create a `ci.yml` file in the `.github/workflows` directory. This workflow will run unit tests, check code quality using tools like flake8 and pylint, and upload code coverage results to Codecov.
**Host A:**
That’s a solid approach. And they’ll also add badges to their README to show the build status and code coverage percentage. This makes it easy for everyone to see the project’s health at a glance.
**Host B (Sam):**
Exactly. It’s all about transparency and ensuring the master branch is always deployable.

**[SEGMENT 3: DEPLOYING TO KUBERNETES]**
**Host A:**
Now, let’s talk about deploying to Kubernetes. This seems like a big step. What do students need to do here?
**Host B (Sam):**
They’ll start by setting up a local Kubernetes cluster using tools like K3S. They’ll create a `k8s` folder in their project repository to store Kubernetes manifest files like `deployment.yaml`, `service.yaml`, and `ingress.yaml`. These files define how Kubernetes should deploy and manage their application.
**Host A:**
And they’ll also need to deploy a database, right?
**Host B (Sam):**
Yes, they’ll deploy a PostgreSQL database as a StatefulSet. This ensures that the database persists data even if pods are restarted or deleted. They’ll create a `postgres` folder under the `k8s` directory with the necessary YAML files.
**Host A:**
What about health checks? How does Kubernetes know if the microservice is running properly?
**Host B (Sam):**
They’ll add a `/health` endpoint that returns a JSON response like `{"status":"OK"}` with a 200 status code. This allows Kubernetes to monitor the service and take corrective action if it goes down.
**Host A:**
That’s smart. And they’ll use `kubectl` to deploy everything to their local cluster. Once deployed, they’ll ensure the ingress is properly configured so the application can be accessed from outside the cluster.

**[SEGMENT 4: USER INTERFACE AND BDD TESTING]**
**Host A:**
Next up is the user interface and automated BDD testing. Let’s dive into that.
**Host B (Sam):**
The UI is for administrators, not end-users. It should provide a simple way to manage the microservice. Students can use the sample UI from the `lab-flask-bdd` repository as a starting point. They’ll create user stories for adding features like creating, reading, updating, and deleting resources.
**Host A:**
And the BDD tests will ensure the UI works as expected. How do they set that up?
**Host B (Sam):**
They’ll write feature files in Gherkin syntax using the behave framework. These features should be understandable by non-technical stakeholders. They’ll also create `steps.py` files to define the test steps. The tests will use Selenium to interact with the UI, ensuring there’s no direct connection to the microservice.
**Host A:**
That’s a great way to keep tests independent. They’ll need at least seven user stories, one for each CRUD operation, plus query and action functionalities.
**Host B (Sam):**
Exactly. And all scenarios must pass before the tests are considered successful. This ensures the UI and API are working together seamlessly.

**[SEGMENT 5: REFACTORING WITH FLASK-RESTX]**
**Host A:**
Now, let’s talk about refactoring the microservice using Flask-RESTX. Why is this important?
**Host B (Sam):**
Flask-RESTX provides better structure and built-in support for Swagger documentation. This makes it easier to document APIs and ensure consistency. Students will refactor their code to use Flask-RESTX, add Swagger annotations, and make sure all HTTP errors return JSON responses instead of HTML.
**Host A:**
And they’ll add a `/apidocs/` endpoint for Swagger documentation. This is a huge help for developers who need to understand how to interact with the API.
**Host B (Sam):**
Absolutely. They’ll also ensure that all tests still pass after refactoring. This is where having good test coverage really pays off.

**[SEGMENT 6: BUILDING THE CD PIPELINE]**
**Host A:**
Finally, let’s talk about building the continuous delivery (CD) pipeline using Tekton. What’s involved here?
**Host B (Sam):**
The pipeline will automate the entire deployment process. It will include six tasks: cloning the repository, linting, testing, building a Docker image, deploying to Kubernetes, and running BDD tests on the deployed application. Students will create YAML files in a `.tekton` folder to define these tasks and the pipeline.
**Host A:**
And they’ll set up a webhook so that any push to the master branch triggers the pipeline. This ensures that every change is automatically tested and deployed.
**Host B (Sam):**
They’ll also need to manually deploy PostgreSQL to their OpenShift cluster and create a route so the microservice can be accessed from outside the cluster. Finally, they’ll demonstrate that the pipeline works during the final sprint review.

**[SEGMENT 7: FINAL SUBMISSION AND TIPS]**
**Host A:**
For the final submission, students need to provide the URL of their service running on the OpenShift cluster. What advice would you give to students working on this project?
**Host B (Sam):**
My top tip is to work incrementally. Tackle one requirement at a time and ensure each part works before moving on. Use ZenHub to track progress and hold regular scrum meetings. Don’t forget to refactor and test thoroughly after each change.
**Host A:**
Great advice. And remember, communication is key. Make sure everyone on the team understands their role and the overall project goals.
